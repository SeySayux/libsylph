Probably you've found this file because an error occurred while trying to link
or to include a file in this directory. That's okay, I just forgot to tell you
you'll have to do some work yourself. First, acquire a copy of the Boehm GC
(it's a free-as-in-speech download, just google for it yourself). I've put
a tarball of v7.1 in the directory, you can use it or any later version. Next,
configure and build it for your platform. You'll have to pass the 
--enable-cplusplus parameter to the configure script in order to make it work
with LibSylph. When you've done that, you'll need to copy a few things. DO NOT
RUN MAKE INSTALL! First, link/copy the include directory here. Next, you'll
also need a file called libgc.a. You can find that in a hidden directory
called .libs, copy it here as well. Then run LibSylph's make again and 
praise the Lord!

* A libgc.a for Mac OS X is included as MacOSX_libgc.a
