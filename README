  1. Dependencies

    1.1 Supported Operating Systems

       Currently, LibSylph can be run most Unix-systems, including, but not
       limited to, Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin, Mac OS X, and a few others.
       In order for the binary relocation function to work (i.e.
       thisapp->getXXX() ), support for /proc/self/exe is required. On Mac OS X,
       the /proc filesystem is not enabled by default. However, OS X provides
       an alternate method for retrieving the full path to the running
       executable, therefore no extra software is needed to function correctly
       on Mac OS X.

       Minimal support for Microsoft Windows is included as well. However, no
       compiler for this platform meets the required features (see 1.2), there-
       fore LibSylph WON'T run on Microsoft Windows currently.

    1.2 Supported Compilers

        As of now, only one specific compiler is supported: the GNU C++ compiler
        (g++), version 4.4.0 or later. LibSylph uses certain GNU C++
        specific extensions. Furthermore, support for certain C++0x constructs
        is required. At the day of writing this document, only the compiler
        mentioned above supports these extensions. In case you found another
        compiler to meet these requirements, please contact
        the LibSylph developers (see section 3.2)

  2. Build Instructions

    2.1 Compiling the source code

        2.1.1 Dependancies
             
            LibSylph depends on boehm-gc,icu, and gettext. You need to have
            these programs installed first. Please consult your operating
            system vendor's manuals or look at our wiki.
        
       2.1.2 Building
    
            To build the source code, issue the following commands:
   
                 cmake .
                 make

            Please note you might need to explicitely specify the path to
            a C++0x compiler by using -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/c++.

    2.2 Installing

        To install LibSylph, issue the following command as root (or your
        operating systems respective administrator account):
 
              make install

    2.3 Running the test suite
 
        To run the test suite, issue the following command in the build
        directory:
 
             make test

        This will build and run the entire test suite.

  3. Acknowledgements

    3.1 Copyright and licensing

        Please see the files `AUTHORS' and `COPYING' to see the names of the
        original authors and the license of the code, respectively.

    3.2 Reporting bugs.

        TODO Mailing list.
        We're poor devs, we don't have a mailing list. Just bother one of us
        with your questions (see `AUTHORS') and if we're in a good mood, we'll
        reply.
