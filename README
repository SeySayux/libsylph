  1. Dependancies

    1.1 Supported Operating Systems

       Currently, LibSylph can be run most Unix-systems, including, but not
       limited to, Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin, Mac OS X, and a few others.
       In order for the binary relocation function to work (i.e.
       thisapp->getXXX() ), support for /proc/self/exe is required. On Mac OS X,
       the /proc filesystem is not enabled by default. However, OS X provides
       an alternate method for retrieving the full path to the running
       executable, therefore no extra software is needed to function correctly
       on Mac OS X.

       Minimal support for Microsoft Windows is included as well. However, no
       compiler for this platform meets the required features (see 1.2), there-
       fore LibSylph WON'T run on Microsoft Windows currently.

    1.2 Supported Compilers

        As of now, only one specific compiler is supported: the GNU C++ compiler
        (g++), version 4.4.0-20081219 or later. LibSylph uses certain GNU C++
        specific extensions. Furthermore, support for C++0x (more specific,
        initializer lists) is required. At the day of writing this document,
        only the compiler mentioned above supports these extensions. In case
        you found another compiler to meet these requirements, please contact
        the LibSylph developers (see section 3.2)

  2. Build Instructions

    2.1 Compiling the source code

        TODO CMake
        Currently it is sufficient to run 'make'. This may or may not work. In
        case it doesn't, don't blame me.

    2.2 Installing

        TODO Cmake
        No installation procedure is included at the moment. Just copy all
        headers to /usr/include and the dynamic library file to /usr/lib.

  3. Acknowledgements

    3.1 Copyright and licensing

        Please see the files `AUTHORS' and `COPYING' to see the names of the
        original authors and the license of the code, respectively.

    3.2 Reporting bugs.

        TODO Mailing list.
        We're poor devs, we don't have a mailing list. Just bother one of us
        with your questions (see `AUTHORS') and if we're in a good mood, we'll
        reply.
