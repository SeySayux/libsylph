# Long description
Description: >
    This branch will make following changes:
    * Rename Sylph.h to SylphMain.h
    * Rename Sylph/Core/Common.h to Sylph.h
    * Include following headers in Sylph.h:
    >>>> * Application
    >>>> * ByteBuffer
    >>>> * I18N
    >>>> * PointerManager
    >>>> * StringBuffer
    >>>> * Util
    >>>> * Vector
    * Include following headers in Sylph.h in their respective branches:
    >>>> * SeySayux/collection
    >>>>>>>> * LinkedList
    >>>>>>>> * HashSet
    >>>>>>>> * HashTree
    >>>> * SeySayux/function:
    >>>>>>>> * Function
    >>>>>>>> * In
    >>>> * SeySayux/thread
    >>>>>>>> * Thread
    >>>>>>>> * Mutex
    >>>> * SeySayux/variant
    >>>>>>>> * Variant
    * Deprecate and eliminate the SYLPH_NO_SYLPHMAIN macro
    
    This will allow for easier programming (include Sylph.h in all files and
    SylphMain.h only in files containing the SylphMain function), at the 
    expense of breaking 0.1 API.
