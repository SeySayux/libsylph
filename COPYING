TODO actual license

If you want to take code from this library, please contact us first (see
`AUTHORS'). If you want to link your program with our library, you're free to do
so, without needing to contact us first, for any purpose you want.

If you want to redistribute this library (binary or source code), please contact
us first as well. You'll probably also have to put our copyright notice
somewhere, as we don't type our fingers to the bone so someone steals all our
hard work, now do we?

I prefer that you don't redistribute modified versions of my source code, as
this can get very confusing (until we have a real licence, that is). Instead,
redistribute patches. If you really want to redistribute a modified version,
please contact us first. If your patches are good, they'll probably go upstream,
which means there is no need to redistribute a version that's different from
upstream.

I don't get any money programming this stuff, it's just a hobby. You didn't pay
for downloading this. That means: no warranty. Use at your own risk. This code
may screw up your computer. This code may eat babies. Etc...

If you've anything to say about this program, just look at the `AUTHORS' file ;)
(I'm getting repetive, no?)
